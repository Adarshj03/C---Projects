<h1> Computation Transmission Parameters In Power System </h1>

Project Overview: 
The project aims to create a software application that calculates transmission parameters for a power system based on user inputs and performs CRUD operations on corresponding bills.

Functionalities:
1.	User Input:
		•	Users input their power consumption data (e.g., in kilowatt-hours, kWh) and other relevant information.

2.	Transmission Parameter Calculation:
		•	Based on the user inputs, calculate transmission parameters like load factor, 
			demand factor, and loss factor. These parameters help in analyzing the efficiency of power consumption and distribution in the system.

3.	Bill Calculation:
		•	Calculate the electricity bill using the consumption data and the calculated transmission parameters. 
			The billing structure may include fixed charges, variable charges based on consumption, and penalties for exceeding certain limits.

4.	CRUD Operations:
		•	Create: Users can input new consumption data and generate bills accordingly.
		•	Read: Users can view their previous consumption data and bills.
		•	Update: Users can edit their consumption data for a specific period, and the bills will be recalculated.
		•	Delete: Users can delete consumption data and corresponding bills.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

1.User Interface:
create a text-based interface using the command line. Users will interact with the system by typing commands and receiving text-based responses.

2.Calculation Algorithms:
Implement the calculation algorithms for transmission parameters and billing using C programming constructs. C provides a rich set of mathematical operations and control structures.

3.Backend Logic:
Write C functions to handle CRUD operations, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting user consumption data and bills.

4. Data Base :
   We are using data.db named file to store our data
5.Testing and Debugging:
Use C unit testing frameworks like CUnit to test the functionality of your functions.

6.Deployment:
Compile your C code into an executable file using a C compiler (e.g., GCC) for distribution and deployment.
